# rockpaperscissors
This program simulates a 2-player game of Rock Paper Scissors. Any number of the 2 players
can either be human or computer-controlled. This game also includes a 1% chance of the results
being completely reversed (i.e. scissors beats rock), and also each computer-controlled player
has a 1% chance of selecting a fourth option, "bomb", which beats rock, paper, and scissors.
